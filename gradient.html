    <p>The action of kicking in (clockwise from upper left) association, gridiron, rugby, and Australian football
    The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football:
    carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the
    ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as association football
    and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.[10]
    
    Common rules among the sports include:[11]
    
    Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are
    also popular.[12]
    A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
    Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a
    line.
    Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.
    The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
    Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.
    In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[10] In most codes,
    there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under
    or over a crossbar between the goalposts.
    
    Etymology
    Main article: Football (word)
    There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that the word "football"
    (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation,
    which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[14] There
    is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.
    
    Early history
    Ancient games
    See also: Episkyros and Cuju
    Ancient China
    
    Emperor Taizu of Song playing cuju (Chinese football) with his prime minister Zhao Pu (趙普) and other ministers, by Yuan
    dynasty artist Qian Xuan (1235–1305)
    The Chinese competitive game cuju is an early type of ball game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling modern
    association football. It was possibly played around the Han dynasty and early Qin dynasty, based on an attestation in a
    military manual from around the second to third centuries BC.[15][16][17] In one version, gameplay consisted of players
    passing the ball between teammates without allowing it to touch the ground (much like keepie uppie). In its competitive
    version, two teams had to pass the ball without it falling, before kicking the ball through a circular hole placed in
    the middle of the pitch. Unlike association football, the two teams did not interact with each other but instead stayed
    on opposite sides of the pitch.[18] Cuju has been cited by FIFA as the earliest form of football.[4]
    The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.[19] This is known to have been
    played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari, several people stand in a circle and
    kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of
    cuju, especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the
    stuffed ball.[20]

    Ancient Greece and Rome
    The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The
    Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ἐπίσκυρος (episkyros)[21][22] or
    φαινίνδα (phaininda),[23] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the
    Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby
    football.[24][25][26][27][28] The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst
    having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the
    follis.[29][30] Episkyros is described as an early form of football by FIFA.[31]
    
    Native Americans
    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in
    many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John
    Davis went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit in Greenland.[32] There are later accounts of an Inuit game
    played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting
    to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown,
    Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.[citation needed] Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar
    to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.
    
    Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before
    this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games
    and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which
    made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as
    its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of "football".[citation needed]
    
    Oceania
    On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls
    which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for "game ball"). The earliest historical account
    is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard
    Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the
    game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other
    players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins
    of Australian rules football.
    
    The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Kī-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field
    divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or
    target.[citation needed]
    
    These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to
    lie in western Europe, especially England.
    
    Turkic peoples
    Mahmud al-Kashgari in his Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, described a game called tepuk among Turks in Central Asia. In the game,
    people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather.[33]

    Medieval and early modern Europe
    Further information: Medieval football
    The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in
    England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed
    to Nennius, which describes "a party of boys ... playing at ball".[34] References to a ball game played in northern
    France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[35] date from the 12th
    century.[36]
    
    
    An illustration of so-called "mob football"
    The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "mob football", would be played in towns or
    between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse,[37]
    struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder[38] to particular geographical points, such as their
    opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.[39] The game was played
    primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[38] and Shrovetide games
    have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).
    
    The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in
    about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:
    
    After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school
    have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and
    wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can
    see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree
    adolescents.[40]
    
    Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea
    that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.
    
    An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:
    "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".[41] Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented
    reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally
    stabbing a player named William Bernard.[42] Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk,
    England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded
    himself".[41]
    
    In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by
    the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by
    hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][43] in the fields of the public from which many
    evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to
    be used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.
    
    In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and
    cock-fighting, or other such idle games",[44] showing that "football" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being
    differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.
    
    
    "Football" in France, circa 1750
    A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act
    1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a
    "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some
    have considered to be passing the ball. The word "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute"
    (strike it here) and later "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the
    ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally
    meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to "get hold of the
    ball before [another player] does" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was
    allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).
    
    King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word "football", in 1409,
    when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".[41][45]
    
    There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire.
    This is the first description of a "kicking game" and the first description of dribbling: "[t]he game at which they had
    met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a
    huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their
    hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions." The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football
    pitch, stating that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.</p></div>
