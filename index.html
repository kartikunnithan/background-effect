    <h1>Songs</h1>
    <p>A song is a musical composition performed by the human voice. The voice often carries the melody (a series of distinct
    and fixed pitches) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs have a structure to them, such as the common ABA form, and
    are usually made of sections that are repeated or performed with variation later. A song without instruments is said to
    be a cappella.
    
    Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a
    pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music, it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated
    pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple style
    that are learned informally "by ear" are often referred to as folk songs. Songs composed for the mass market, designed
    to be sung by professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows, are called popular songs. These songs, which
    have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists; art songs are composed by
    trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed in studios and an audio recording
    is made, or they are performed "live" for audience. (In some cases a song may be performed live and simultaneously
    recorded.) Songs may also appear in theatre (e.g., opera), films and TV shows.
    
    A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble
    involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms
    including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead.[1] A song can be sung without
    accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. In popular music, a singer may perform
    with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. In jazz, a singer may perform with a
    single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. A Classical singer may perform with a
    single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs "by ear" and they may
    improvise some melody lines. In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet music format, so singers
    learn to read music.
    
    Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works. Songs can be
    broadly divided into many different forms and types, depending on the criteria used. Through semantic widening, a
    broader sense of the word "song" may refer to instrumentals, such as the 19th century Songs Without Words pieces for
    solo piano.[</p>
